# Universal GMS Doze
## Â© 2018 GL-DP, gloeyisk ##



This module is a simple way to force dozing GMS (Google Mobile Services) systemlessly. The way it works is aiming for unrestrict Google Play services running in background (puted into Optimized automatically) for avoid draining battery. Doze is designed to work entirely in the background, without your involvement. But if you want more control, you can configure it with third-party apps. 
As a main function this module included XiaomiDoze prebuilt and can be used universal (for another devices other than Xiaomi) with additional features for aggressive doze and maintain deep sleep.
And also this module used third-party code: Unity (Un)Installer for made it easily for install/uninstall while something really went wrong. Thanks to [Zackptg5](https://github.com/Zackptg5) for the [Unity Template](https://github.com/Zackptg5/Unity).
